/**
 * Shazam API Client (Placeholder for post-hackathon implementation)
 * 
 * This file is a placeholder for future implementation using the Shazam API
 * via RapidAPI instead of ACRCloud. This will be implemented after the
 * hackathon to switch to the more cost-effective API for long-term use.
 * 
 * Shazam API offers approximately 17 free song identifications per day with
 * its free tier (500/month).
 * 
 * Implementation Notes:
 * - Will need to use the same interface as acrcloud-client.js for easy swapping
 * - Will need to transform Shazam API response to match our established data contract
 * - Will need to add YouTube ID lookup as Shazam doesn't provide this directly
